        The job role is ${role}.
        The job experience level is ${level}.
        The tech stack used in the job is: ${techstack}.
        The focus between behavioural and technical questions should lean towards: ${type}.
        The amount of questions required is: ${amount}.

           Important guidelines: 
        - Each question must focus on ONE clear topic or skill only.
        - Do not combine multiple questions into one (no multi-part or overloaded questions).
        - Phrase questions in a professional, clear, and natural style â€” as a real top company interviewer would.
        - Avoid overly casual or robotic phrasing.
        - Behavioral questions should follow real-world formats (e.g., STAR method prompts).
        - Technical questions should challenge core understanding without being confusing or overwhelming.
        - If a topic is complex, split it into separate focused questions instead of stacking.
        - Please return only the questions, without any additional text.
        - The questions are going to be read by a voice assistant so do not use "/" or "*" or any other special characters which might break the voice assistant.
        - Return the questions formatted like this:
          ["Question 1", "Question 2", "Question 3"] for as many questions needed.
